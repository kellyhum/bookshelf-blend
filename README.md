# bookshelf blend

> a tool that calculates the similarity percentage between you and a friend (+ other stats)

> currently a work in progress!

#### todos

-   figure out why test results don't show up (but are console.logged out)
-   adjust color scheme + general ui
-   add the ability to add books to shelf instead of just searching
-   blend button -> calculating results page (using react router or...?)

#### lessons learned while building

-   force pushed a backend implementation onto the front end, didn't realize it would wipe out all the previous commits...
-   reverted from the full backend express implementation to just frontend + firebase b/c i didn't need that much code for such simplistic usage
